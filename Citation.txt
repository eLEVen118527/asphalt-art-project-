Resources that helped with code: my partner (obviously), youtube videos, and lesson 11, 10, 6, and 4. 


My partner and I collaborated and figured out the layout of our program and
what methods we needed to use in order to get our highest calorie, average protein 
and total calories. She created most of the UML diagram of all the instance variable we
I wanted to use it along with the idea of the methods. 


When it came to Youtube videos, I searched "how to add to an array in Java?" 
and "Adding Elements to an Array in Java?" along with this video of Java arrays 
that really helped us understand how to create our new Food[] maxFoods which is an 
array of the food objects. Sadly I need to remember how to do the this.something method so
I watched "Java Constructors - Full tutorial." 

When it came to our code.org lessons I used this along with Youtube to better understand how 
each aspect of the while loop and for loop use the int i = 0; i < count; i++ which I would say 
was the hardest part for me as I am still learning how to do it along with my partner. When looking through the lessons I used these examples that I look at as math problems when calculating the average or total of something. Lesson 5, (methods and return values) helped me the most when I had to call names from other classes and use the parameters correctly. Lesson 6 was about conditionals and that helped me a lot because I knew I would need a lot of if-else statements for if the food item was in my dataset or not and  a while loop for the user input because it needed to ask repeatedly until it was a food item in my dataset.
